> I'm Buttbot! I say butt!

> I'll buttify roughly one in every 30 messages by replacing some of the syllables in the message with the word "butt". If the result is the same message or just "butt" I throw it out. The word used as well as the frequency and rate of buttification can be changed.

A [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot based on the [Twitch bot of the same name](https://www.twitch.tv/buttsbot/about). Buttification is random, but roughly follows the set frequency and rate.

Original bot created by [pinguino](https://www.twitch.tv/pinguino) and maintained by [tininsteelian](https://www.twitch.tv/tininsteelian)

Emotes used in responses by this deployment are copies of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) global emotes in an attempt to reproduce the same experience
