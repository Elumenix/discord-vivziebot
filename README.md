# buttsbot

> I'm Buttbot! I say butt!

> I'll buttify roughly one in every 30 messages by replacing some of the syllables in the message with the word "butt". If the result is the same message or just "butt" I throw it out. The word used as well as the frequency and rate of buttification can be changed.

# Usage

## Invite to Your Server

### [Invite buttsbot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=780539847764082768&permissions=0&scope=bot)

buttsbot can be invited to your server with the above link.

## Install to Your Machine

Alternatively you can run your own version of buttsbot by cloning this repository and installing the required dependencies.

After installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and cloning this repository, run the following command in the package directory:

```
npm install
```

Then put your bot's token and your user ID in `./cfg/config.json` in their respective fields.

After filling out `./cfg/config.json` with the relevant information, you can just run the following command:

```
node .
```

###### Personally, I run an external script to automatically restart the program in case the bot disconnects.
