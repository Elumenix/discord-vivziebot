# buttsbot

> I'm Buttbot! I say butt!
> 
> I'll buttify roughly one in every 30 messages by replacing some of the syllables in the message with the word "butt". If the result is the same message or just "butt" I throw it out. The word used as well as the frequency and rate of buttification can be changed.
